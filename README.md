<b>What is celo?</b>

Celo is a Proof of Stake Layer-1 EVM compatible blockchain, optimized for DeFi, which is designed to be mobile-first and climate friendly.

Celo also uses an ultralight client, which utilizes Zero-Knowledge proofs, to allow for syncing with the Celo blockchain extremely fast. The ZKP allows for quick verification of the chain syncing computation, without having to sync the entire chain locally.

Celo uses a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, which allows for cheap and fast transactions on the network.
